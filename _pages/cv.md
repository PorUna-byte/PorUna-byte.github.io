## Profile
I am currently a Master's student specializing in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at Fudan University, with a strong background in computer science and applied mathematics. I am seeking to utilize my academic insights and practical experience in text watermarking to contribute to the Tencent team as a summer intern.

## Objective
Aspiring NLP researcher focused on aligning large language model with human value. I aim to deepen my expertise through the summer internship at Tencent, enhancing my career in the field.

## Education
**Fudan University** \
*Master's Student in Natural Language Processing* \
Expected Graduation: June 2025
**Harbin Institute of Technology** \
*Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Technology* \
Graduated: June 2022

## Experience
Currently, I have no formal internship experience. However, I have engaged extensively in academic projects and collaborative coding initiatives that have honed my skills and understanding in the field.

## Projects
**Travel Agent** \
*Tools Used: Python, Langchain, ChatGPT* \
Primary developer of an intelligent travel planner leveraging ChatGPT. Focused on addressing the challenges of creating travel plans that are reasonable, personalized, and up-to-date. Developed strategies to enhance the reasoning capabilities of base models and integrate user preferences with current global information.
**GumbelSoft: Diversified Language Model Watermarking via the GumbelMax-Trick** \
*Tools Used: Python, PyTorch, Llama2* \
First author of a project aimed at embedding highly detectable watermarks while maintaining text quality and diversity. Innovated text watermarking approaches by modifying the language model's decoding strategy using the GumbelMax trick.
**P4: Plug-and-Play Discrete Prompting for Large Language Models Personalization** \
*Tools Used: Python, PyTorch, Vicuna* \
In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play prompting method to manipulate the LLMs' personality traits. Specifically, we append discrete personalized suffixes, automatically generated through an aggregated gradient-based search method, to the user query or dialog histories and induce LLMs to respond with target personalities.
